## Code of Conduct Report

Please DO NOT add sensitive information (passwords, private documents) to a
public issue. When possible, prefer emailing the maintainers at
**[kirumachi@proton.me](mailto:kirumachi@proton.me)** or use the private
issue option.

If you choose to submit this report as a private issue, please include as
much of the following as you can:

- Date and time of incident (with timezone)
- Where the incident occurred (repository, issue/PR URL, chat room,
  event, etc.)
- Names or handles of involved parties
- A detailed description of what happened
- Any supporting evidence (screenshots, logs, URLs)
- Whether you want your identity to be kept confidential

What we will do:

- Acknowledge receipt of your report within a reasonable timeframe
- Treat reports confidentially to the extent possible and follow applicable
  privacy and legal obligations
- Investigate the report and take appropriate action, which may include
  moderation, mediation, or escalation

If you emailed the maintainers directly
([kirumachi@proton.me](mailto:kirumachi@proton.me)), please provide the same
information as above in your message and indicate whether you gave
permission to share any provided evidence with other maintainers.

Thank you for helping keep this community safe.
